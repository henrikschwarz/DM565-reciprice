\section{Introduction}
This report concerns the innovation project in the Formal Languages and Data Processing
course. The task of this project is to find an idea for a product involving some type of
open data, and then  evaluate the this idea as a
basis for a startup in a structured manner with the business model canvas.
Finally we need to construct a prototype showing the idea in practice. 
\section{Idea Description}
\begin{comment}
 we need to focus our idea, as discussed in the midwayseminar. The best is to have a core
idea that we focus on. 
\end{comment}
The basis of the idea is to  web scrape recipes of different sites, to create a database
of various recipes and the ingredients of these recipes. This database of recipes and
ingredients will then be
paired with the cost of these ingredients included in the recipe. This will enable us to
show an estimate of the cost of making the recipe. The cost of the different ingredients can be
found using the public product suggestion API made by the retail company Salling. This API
references the prices on the \url{bilkatogo.dk} website. Another resource for current
pricing information is from the \url{etilbudsavisen.dk} API, which shows the current
offers of local chains. Prices are also available on some pages that do not have any APIs.
Here is another place that we may need to use web scraping. This price information can
be used to let the users query recipes based on their specific budgets. Another way for
the product to utilize the price information, is that the user can input their current owned
ingredients, and get suggestions on  recipes of which the user is only missing a few
ingredients to be able to make. This can help combat the waste of food.


\section{Idea Evaluation}

For evaluating our idea the business model canvas will be used. The business model canvas
is a template for systematically documenting the business model of an existing business or
prospect startup. The business model canvas focuses on four different key areas of a
building a sustainable business: \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item Infrastructure
  \item Offering
  \item Customers
  \item Finances
\end{enumerate}
