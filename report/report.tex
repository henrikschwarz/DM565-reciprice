\section{Introduction}
This report concerns the innovation project in the Formal Languages and Data Processing
course. The task of this project is to find an idea for a product involving some type of
open data, and then  evaluate the this idea as a
basis for a startup in a structured manner with the business model canvas.
Finally we need to construct a prototype showing the idea in practice. 
\section{Idea Description}
\begin{comment}
 we need to focus our idea, as discussed in the midwayseminar. The best is to have a core
idea that we focus on. 
\end{comment}
The basis of the idea is to  web scrape recipes of different sites, to create a database
of various recipes and the ingredients of these recipes. This database of recipes and
ingredients will then be
paired with the cost of these ingredients included in the recipe. This will enable us to
show an estimate of the cost of making the recipe. The cost of the different ingredients can be
found using the public product suggestion API made by the retail company Salling. This API
references the prices on the \url{bilkatogo.dk} website. Another resource for current
pricing information is from the \url{etilbudsavisen.dk} API, which shows the current
offers of local chains. Prices are also available on some pages that do not have any APIs.
Here is another place that we may need to use web scraping. This price information can
be used to let the users query recipes based on their specific budgets. Another way for
the product to utilize the price information, is that the user can input their current owned
ingredients, and get suggestions on  recipes of which the user is only missing a few
ingredients to be able to make. This can help combat the waste of food.


\section{Idea Evaluation}

For evaluating our idea the business model canvas will be used. The business model canvas
is a template for systematically documenting the business model of an existing business or
prospect startup. The business model canvas focuses on four different key areas of a
building a sustainable business: \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item Infrastructure
  \item Offering
  \item Customers
  \item Finances
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Offering}
The offering is the our value proposition. The value proposition is the services that our
product provides. The value proposition is what sets the product apart from the
competition. To answer what our value proposition we must answer some questions:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item What value we deliver to the customer?
    \subitem The value which we provide to the customer, is to give the ability to view
    prices of items that are in a given recipe, this will also present the total cost of
    the recipe to the customer. The product will also provide value in enabling the
    customer to submit their own recipes, to share with other customers. Given that we
    have different recipes with price data, we can also provide the users with options for
    a number of recipes given different price points.
  \item Which problem do we solve for the customer?
  \subitem The problem we solve for the customer is the issue of estimating the cost of a
    given recipe. Another problem, which we could solve for the customer is the issue of
    finding a recipe for which the user already has the ingredients (or some subset of
    ingredients). Solving this problem for the customer can also contribute to less wasted
    food.
  \item What bundles of products and services are we offering to each Customer Segment?
    \subitem It clear that different services can cater to different customer segments.
    Eg. more cost-concious consumers may be drawn to the feature of a total cost
    estimate of a given recipe.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Infrastructure}
\subsubsection{Key Activities}
The key activities, are the most important activities for executing our value proposition.
To provide value for our customers we examine which key activities our value proposition
requires. Our key activities are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To provide value in terms of offering a price estimate on recipes, we first and
foremost must establish a system, which handles recipes and the ingredients of these
recipes. The ingredients of the different recipes must be linked with prices of products.
  \item We must provide a way of presenting the recipes to the user in appealing way.
  \item Providing ways for the customer to participate in a community, thus engaging the
    customer and pushing them to share recipes and thus provide value for other customers. 
\end{enumerate}
