\section{Introduction}
This report concerns the innovation project in the Formal Languages and Data Processing
course. The task of this project is to find an idea for a product involving some type of
open data, and then  evaluate the this idea as a
basis for a startup in a structured manner with the business model canvas.
Finally we need to construct a prototype showing the idea in practice. 
\section{Idea Description}
\begin{comment}
 we need to focus our idea, as discussed in the midwayseminar. The best is to have a core
idea that we focus on. 
\end{comment}
The basis of the idea is to  web scrape recipes of different sites, to create a database
of various recipes and the ingredients of these recipes. This database of recipes and
ingredients will then be
paired with the cost of these ingredients included in the recipe. This will enable us to
show an estimate of the cost of making the recipe. The cost of the different ingredients can be
found using the public product suggestion API made by the retail company Salling. This API
references the prices on the \url{bilkatogo.dk} website. Another resource for current
pricing information is from the \url{etilbudsavisen.dk} API, which shows the current
offers of local chains. Prices are also available on some pages that do not have any APIs.
Here is another place that we may need to use web scraping. This price information can
be used to let the users query recipes based on their specific budgets. Another way for
the product to utilize the price information, is that the user can input their current owned
ingredients, and get suggestions on  recipes of which the user is only missing a few
ingredients to be able to make. This can help combat the waste of food.


\section{Idea Evaluation}

For evaluating our idea the business model canvas will be used. The business model canvas
is a template for systematically documenting the business model of an existing business or
prospect startup. The business model canvas focuses on four different key areas of a
building a sustainable business: \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item Infrastructure
  \item Offering
  \item Customers
  \item Finances
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Offering}
The offering is the our value proposition. The value proposition is the services that our
product provides. The value proposition is what sets the product apart from the
competition. To answer what our value proposition we must answer some questions:

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item What value we deliver to the customer?
    \subitem The value which we provide to the customer, is to give the ability to view
    prices of items that are in a given recipe, this will also present the total cost of
    the recipe to the customer. The product will also provide value in enabling the
    customer to submit their own recipes, to share with other customer.
  \item Which one of our customer's problems are we helping to solve? 
  \item What bundles of products and services are we offering to each Customer Segment?
  \item Which customer needs are we satisfying?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Infrastructure}
\subsubsection{Key Activities}
The key activities, are the most important activities for executing our value proposition.
